Inventory Forecaster

Inventor Forecaster is a web application enabling users to calculate inventory needs to procure for future project installations by selecting parts and entering quantities needed.  The purpose is to reduce overhead costs during a project rollout and to keep inventory at acceptable levels due to limited warehouse space.


Stretch Goals

#1 - Add a page to allow a user to build a template of a BOM (Bill of Materials) for any particular project.

#2 - Add a page to allow a user to edit a BOM template

#3 - Add fields to the Forecasts page to allow a user to dynamically select as many BOM templates as they want and select how many of these BOM templates to forecast material needs.  A calculate button would be added which would then tally up all the required material quantities, compare against what is available in the database, and show the quantity needed.
